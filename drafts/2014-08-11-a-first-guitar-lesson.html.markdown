Hi! Do you have a guitar? Great! I hope you haven't touched it at all yet, but it's ok if you have. I have some advice for you!

I've taught a __lot__ of people guitar. Like a million. Just kidding, but it's definitely in the triple digits. I also spent a lot of years struggling with some technical issues that I probably should have avoided.
