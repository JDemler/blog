title: Advice for Recursers
layout: post
---

Now's the part where I give advice for new Recursers. A lot of it echoes the
advice you've likely already heard, but that's okay. Sometimes you hear things
more often because they carry some truth in them, and hearing them even more can
help them stick (not always on either counts). Some of this is straight out of
the manual. It's all just my opinions, though, and is in no way meant to
disparage folks who did other things, even things that directly contradict this
advice. Everyone does it differently, YMMV, we are all different, like a
snowflake. or a little baby.

- Don't spend your time on books or MOOCS or courses that you could do at other times.

This is just my opinion, but those resources will be there before and after
your batch; your cohort will not be there (at least not _there_ in the physical
space sense, most likely). If you really feel strongly about something, definitely do
it! But I would tell you that I think that probably it's not the best use of
your batch time to hole up in a room with a textbook or do a series of
tutorials.  Exceptions being: book/study clubs, or groups working on the same
types of things together.

- Pair, pair, pair, pair, pair, pair, pair.

Everyone says this. Everyone says they wish they'd paired more. Pair often, on
small things, for small amounts of time, or big things, for long times, if
you're really into it.  Don't be afraid to pair on a language you don't know
well or on a problem space you're unfamiliar with. Your cohort is and will
long remain an amazing resource, use it! Also, know when to stop! When  you
agree to pair on something, you might realize quickly after you've begun that
you're not all that interested in it after all. That's ok too!

- Regardless of what you're working on, start where you're at.

There were people in my batch implementing programming languages. There were
other people (like me!) who barely knew anything at all. Start where you're at,
and if you don't know where you're at, ask someone to help you figure it out. I
think this is one of the most valuable things the facilitators and more
experienced Recursers can do in a batch, actually, just to give more context
and direction.

Recently, I've been wanting to learn math, and specifically statistics, which I
think would be helpful to understand at least the rudiments of. I asked Yuri
(who is a statistician by training) for a book recommendation. He gave me
[this](). I decided that I was going to read it until I didn't understand
something and then learn that thing before moving on.

I opened the stats book, the first sentence in the first page of the
introduction said "A thorough understanding of calculus is required to grasp
this material". I shut the book, set it aside, and bought a calculus book.

I opened the calculus book and the first sentence said "You should understand
Algebra, Trigonometry, and Geometry before tackling calculus". I shut that book
and put it aside, and bought an Algebra book.

I opened the Algebra book and the first sentence said "This is the number line." I
thought, ok *that* I can do.

I haven't taken a math class since high school, I was a music and literature
major in undergrad. I'm not excited about my lack of math understanding, but
I'm not ashamed of it, either. If I tried to learn stats in a vacuum I would
_fail_; being honest with myself about what I really know and where I need to
start is _important_. I'm a 33 year old professional programmer, and I'm
currently learning college level algebra. Start where you're at.

This is just a straight up reblog, because I love this post. thanks Zach, and
write more.

I do struggle with this; I'm an all or nothing kind of fellow. "Either," I
think "work all the time until the thing is done, or" (I cluck disdainfully at
myself) "don't do it at all." Sometimes, this attitude is a super power...
sometimes, and other times, it is _not at all_ a superpower. Figuring out the
difference is a process; I'd like to think I'm getting better at it.
