title: What I did before Hacker School
layout: post
---

I wrote a [post](/corridor) about going to the Recurse Center (n√©e Hacker School) the night
before I started my batch. I stand behind it, there were good feels in there.
But I never wrote about _how I got there_. Which, if I were me reading my own
post a year prior, I would, like, you know, really wanted to have known. I've been
meaning to write this post for _years_ now, which is ridiculous, but better
late than never?

In the Spring of 2013, I couldn't `ls`. I hadn't programmed anything since a
Qbasic class I took in probably 4th grade, and the only program I could remember was

```basic
10 PRINT "HELLO"
20 GOTO 10
```

Or something.

The very first thing that got my wheels turning on this- it was around January
of 2013 or so, maybe... I was working on permutations of different four voiced
chordal structures on the guitar, mostly by hand and in my head, trying to come
up with a relatively complete set. Any shape would have one of

```
7  different chord qualities
4  different inversions (including root position)
12 different root notes
4  differentvoicings
```

The specifics of these, while interesting, are not pertinent right now. I just
needed to figure out a lot of different permutations! For any given chord, I
could see how it fell along these dimensions easily, but I was trying to figure
out _everything_ because I am a commited completest sometimes, and also I
wanted to build some practice plans around them.

I thought, wouldn't it be nice to have all these in a spreadsheet or something?
That would take forever to write out. This is like, the perfect thing to make a
computer do for me, right? I called my old buddy
[Yuri](http://stacoscimus.com/), a fine musician and bash scriptor, and he
recited a one liner over the phone that did exactly what I wanted:

```bash
echo {A,Bb,B,C,Db,D,Eb,E,F,Gb,G,Ab}{M7,m7,7,m7b5,dim7,mM7,M7#5}_{0,1,2,3}_{drop2,drop2/3,drop2/4,drop3/4}
```

This was completely incomprehensible to me at the time, as I was
still afraid of opening the terminal, but that didn't matter, because _it
totally worked_. I had my giant list of voicings. Wheels turning.

Sometime a few weeks after that I stumbled on an article about the then new to
NY [App Academy](http://www.wired.com/2013/03/free-learn-to-code-boot-camp/). I
hadn't heard of the bootcamp model before then, but was heartened to learn
about their "you don't owe us until you get a job" payment structure. There was
no way I was going to be able to afford a 10-15 thousand dollar course up
front, but this I could do. A few days later I applied, and they wrote back
promptly with instructions on preparing for and taking an initial coding
challenge. It wasn't as fleshed out as what they have now, but the basic gist
of it was this:

http://prepwork.appacademy.io/coding-test-1/

I spent a couple of weeks going through those materials and completed the
challenge. They again got back promptly, this time asking me to complete a
second one. At this point, I was pretty chuffed! I had begun to start
thinking about this path as something that might be not only _possible_ but
_really fun_. I hadn't told anyone but Yuri about _any_ of this yet.

I went through the materials for the second challenge:

http://prepwork.appacademy.io/coding-test-2/

I went out and bought the books they recommended at the time:

https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/

http://peterc.org/beginningruby/

and worked through them voraciously. I think they also recommended tryruby.com
and I found that to be really helpful, as well.

It was a lot all at once, and it was very overwhelming at times. When I looked
at the [curriculum](http://www.appacademy.io/curriculum), I saw a _whole bunch
of idk_. But I had told myself that I was at least going to try.

There was no deadline for the second challenge, so I spent about 3 months
working through all these things. I didn't want to half ass it.

Finally, I took the second challenge, and though I don't think I _bombed_ it,
exactly, I didn't do that great, either. I wasn't invited to an interview. This
was a disappointment, but not a surprise; I had been programming for about a
month, after all, and programming is hard, right?

I had been doing research about other bootcamps this whole time. Most of them
were pay up front, which made them impossible for me to attend. But one of them
wasn't, because one of them was Hacker School.

I don't remember how I found them first. There aren't _that_ many things
online. I do remember finding this video:

And being really inspired by it. It sounded like something I could do! And then I read their manual:

This really resonated, like really.

HS had (and has) very different application criteria.
