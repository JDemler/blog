anecdote about yuri bashing permutations of different sets

same week I read about app academy. got to thinking, so I started messing around with ruby.
yuri asked me a few little problems, fizzbuzz probably, some other stuff. don't remember exactly... but he was super supportive.c

I don't remember what I did for the first week or so, I just farted around. printing things to the screen, stuff like that. I didn't tell anyone though, not really, not except for yuri, really. that becomes important later.

I had been messing for two weeks, when I found a link to the cue programming challenge.

first nerd snipe, when I solved it and got the thing that said to send me their resume, I was aghast, I had no idea that I had just worked on a hiring thing all night, it was an amazing feeling! that is when I first started to think that maybe this was something I could do.

the day after I decided to finish the coding challenge for app acc. didn't get in, waitlist

so I applied to app academy, spent another few weeks messing around, again don't remember what... looked at their curriculum, it was so overwhelming, so many things.

applied but got waitlisting, they sent a list of resource

why ruby? there were a few reasons- app academy did ruby, so that was a big one.

tryruby, some online beginner things I don't really remember
and then the cue programming challenge

books I read:
