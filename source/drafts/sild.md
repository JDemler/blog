I read somewhere that you're not really a lisp programmer until you've
implemented your own interpreter. Fair enough, I guess, and although that's
exactly the kind of sweeping, obnoxious statement that makes people not want to
talk to you at parties... it really stuck with me. People who like lisp
_really_ like lisp, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, but for a
long time I just didn't know where to start. I had implemented a toy
interpreter in Ruby a while back, which was edifying, but I've always found
building your own data structures in a higher level language kind of...
pointless? It's great for learning concepts, for sure, but you're building
abstractions on top of the (probably) better and (definitely) more efficient
abstractions of your host language. I wanted to know how to implement something
on the bare metal of the machine; I wanted to build my own abstraction from
the memory on up.

Lisp stands for "LISt Processor," so maybe lists
