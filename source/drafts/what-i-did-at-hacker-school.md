it's been a while. I should have written this post literally years ago. But I
didn't. Phooey on me. but, better late than never? whatever, here it is.

projects:

- rubyks cube

started as the thing I wrote from before (stuff I did before) ended up being
super instructive on how to spin up a web app on my own server, leading me down
a rabbit hole of aws and nginx. Oh my god, nginx was so hard.

- fux

thing that reads in humdrum files and outputs sine waves through supercollider
via overtone.

did it in clojure for god knows why
