I very much like sounds.

I like all kinds of sounds, really, but I like harmonies most of all. I don't mean just nice sounding things, pretty chords, sing song melodies, altough I like those as well, and sometimes best of all, but I mean, more generally speaking, noises that have been organized or just happen to have some kind of structure to them, all together speaking, noise that is interesting.

The sounds of engines, not too loud, repeating some sorts of patterns, have always been pleasant to my ear. (as was the smell of gasoline, perhaps related?)

But ok, so what the fuck is sound, exactly? Let's start from the very very beginning.

I'm going to skip over a lot of the anatomy and brain sciencey parts of how we perceive music, both because I don't know that much about it and because that's not what I'm interested in for the moment. We can assume, gentle reader, that on the whole we mostly perceive things the same way. lol jklol jk,.......
